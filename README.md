##Proyect Overview

In the context of Earth observation satellite missions, the electronic characterization of radio frequency (RF) signals in communication links is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of satellite communication systems. These missions rely on the transmission and reception of data through RF communication links to gather crucial information about the Earth. Therefore, detailed characterization of RF signals is fundamental to ensure the integrity and reliability of the data transmitted to and from the satellites.
